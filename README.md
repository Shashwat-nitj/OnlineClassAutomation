# OnlineClassAutomation
*Bored of joining online classes day and night?
Missed some?...just bcz?
Store your time table, run the software in the background, let your system handle things by itself from now on..*
## Steps for set up </br>
1. Open the excel file. Fill the required info. (Hints and Sample sheet given) </br>
2. Run the app. (Yup. That's it) </br>
## Glimpse on Algorithm</br>
1. Signs in in Google and Microsoft (whosever credentials are provided in excel / or both)</br>
2. Identifies which day's time table to follow today.</br>
3. Sorts the day's list according to start time of classes (You don't need to provide the list in order)</br>
4. Checks if a class is already going on, if yes, then joins it.
5. Selects the class which is EARLIEST in the FUTURE, waits for its start time to arrive, and then joins it.</br>
6. It itself decides whether the link is of Google meet or Microsoft teams, acc. to that meeting is joined.
7. Waits for given duration, then leaves the meeting.</br>
## Salient Features</br>
1. Default mode is all permissions off (audio, video, notification, etc.)</br>
2. If email / password are wrong signin of that particular portal is aborted, and the program keeps running.</br>
*If there is a meeting scheduled at that particular portal, you are notified of the error at the time of the meeting.*</br>
3. You can run the software, minimize the new chrome window opened and simply ignore it.</br>
4. You are kept notified of what's being going on through windows notification.</br>
5. All actions of the program (Joining, Leaving, Initializing Portals, Signing in, etc.) are recorder in the python output screen, which can be saved for record.</br>
