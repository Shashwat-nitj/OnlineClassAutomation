# OnlineClassAutomation
*Bored of joining online classes day and night?
Missed some?...just bcz?
Store your time table, run the software in the background, let your system handle things by itself from now on..*
## Steps for set up </br>
1. Open the excel file. Fill the required info. (Hints and Sample sheet given) </br>
2. Run the app. (Yup. That's it) </br>
## Glimpse on Algorithm</br>
1. Signs in in Google and Microsoft (whosever credentials are provided in excel / or both)</br>
2. Identifies which day's time table to follow today.</br>
3. Sorts the day's list according to start time of classes (You don't need to fill it in order)</br>
4. Algorithm chooses the class which is EARLIEST in the FUTURE, waits for its start time to arrive, and then joins it.</br>
5. If a class is currently going on, it receives higher preference.</br>
6. It itself decides whether the link is of Google meet or Microsoft teams, acc. to that meeting is joined.
7. Waits for given duration, then leaves the meeting.</br>
