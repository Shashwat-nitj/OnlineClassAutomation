# OnlineClassAutomation
*Bored of joining online classes day and night just for the sake of attendence?
Missed some?...just bcz?
Store your time table, run the software in the background, let your system handle things by itself from now on..*
## Steps for set up </br>
1. Open the excel file. Fill the required info. (Hints and Sample sheet given) </br>
2. Run the app. (Yup. That's it) </br>
## Glimpse on Algorithm</br>
1. Signs in in Google and Microsoft (whosever credentials are provided in excel / or both)</br>
2. Identifies which day's time table to follow today.</br>
3. Sorts the day's list according to start time of classes (You don't need to provide the list in order)</br>
4. Checks if a class is already going on, if yes, then joins it.
5. Selects the class which is EARLIEST in the FUTURE, waits for its start time to arrive, and then joins it.</br>
6. It itself decides whether the link is of Google meet or Microsoft teams, acc. to that meeting is joined.
7. Waits for given duration, then leaves the meeting.</br>
## Salient Features</br>
1. **Don't Worry! No one will listen!** Default mode is all permissions off (audio, video, notification, etc.)</br> 
2. If email / password are wrong, and the program won't crash.</br>
*Signin of that particular portal is skipped for now, If there is a meeting scheduled at that particular portal, you are notified of the error at the time of the meeting.*</br>
3. **Sit Back and Chill!** You can run the software, minimize the new chrome window opened and use the rest of your system (You can even open a new tab in the running chrome window to do work, but it is not advised).</br>
4. **You will know, Jon Snow!** You are kept notified of steps taken by the program through windows notification.</br>
5. **We have the evidence!** All actions of the program (Joining, Leaving, Initializing Portals, Signing in, etc.) are recorded in the python output screen, which can be saved for record.</br>
6. **Better late then never** If you can run the program after several classes, present and upcoming classes will be considered by the algorithm.
